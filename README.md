# Base Lang

A simple interpreted language, designed around minimalism. It is a fully Turing complete language. As of now, we only have an interpreted version. However, in the future we plan to integrate compilation to Low Level Virtual Machine Intermediate Representation (LLVM IR).

**NOTICE:** This interpreter is not designed for anything more than thought experiement. It is not a fully integrated programming language, and should not be used in a deployement enviorenment.
